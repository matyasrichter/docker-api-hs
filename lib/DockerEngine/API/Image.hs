   Docker Engine API

   The Engine API is an HTTP API served by Docker Engine. It is the API the Docker client uses to communicate with the Engine, so everything the Docker client can do can be done with the API.  Most of the client's commands map directly to API endpoints (e.g. `docker ps` is `GET /containers/json`). The notable exception is running containers, which consists of several API calls.  # Errors  The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:  ``` {   \"message\": \"page not found\" } ```  # Versioning  The API is usually changed in each release, so API calls are versioned to ensure that clients don't break. To lock to a specific version of the API, you prefix the URL with its version, for example, call `/v1.30/info` to use the v1.30 version of the `/info` endpoint. If the API version specified in the URL is not supported by the daemon, a HTTP `400 Bad Request` error message is returned.  If you omit the version-prefix, the current version of the API (v1.41) is used. For example, calling `/info` is the same as calling `/v1.41/info`. Using the API without a version-prefix is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  Engine releases in the near future should support this version of the API, so your client will continue to work even if it is talking to a newer Engine.  The API uses an open schema model, which means server may add extra properties to responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and request body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional properties in responses to ensure they do not break when talking to newer daemons.   # Authentication  Authentication for registries is handled client side. The client has to send authentication details to various endpoints that need to communicate with registries, such as `POST /images/(name)/push`. These are sent as `X-Registry-Auth` header as a [base64url encoded](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5) (JSON) string with the following structure:  ``` {   \"username\": \"string\",   \"password\": \"string\",   \"email\": \"string\",   \"serveraddress\": \"string\" } ```  The `serveraddress` is a domain/IP without a protocol. Throughout this structure, double quotes are required.  If you have already got an identity token from the [`/auth` endpoint](#operation/SystemAuth), you can just pass this instead of credentials:  ``` {   \"identitytoken\": \"9cbaf023786cd7...\" } ```

-- *** imageBuild

-- | @POST \/build@
-- 
-- Build an image
-- 
-- Build an image from a tar archive with a `Dockerfile` in it.  The `Dockerfile` specifies how the image is built from the tar archive. It is typically in the archive's root, but can be at a different path or have a different name by specifying the `dockerfile` parameter. [See the `Dockerfile` reference for more information](/engine/reference/builder/).  The Docker daemon performs a preliminary validation of the `Dockerfile` before starting the build, and returns an error if the syntax is incorrect. After that, each instruction is run one-by-one until the ID of the new image is output.  The build is canceled if the client drops the connection by quitting or being killed.

If the URI points to a single text file, the file’s contents are placed into a file called `Dockerfile` and the image is built from that file. If the URI points to a tarball, the file is downloaded by the daemon and the contents therein used as the context for the build. If the URI points to a tarball and the `dockerfile` parameter is also specified, there must be a file with the corresponding path inside the tarball.
instance HasOptionalParam ImageBuild Remote where

instance HasOptionalParam ImageBuild Cpuquota where
  applyOptionalParam req (Cpuquota xs) =
    req `addQuery` toQuery ("cpuquota", Just xs)

-- | /Optional Param/ "buildargs" - JSON map of string pairs for build-time variables. Users pass these values at build-time. Docker uses the buildargs as the environment context for commands run via the `Dockerfile` RUN instruction, or for variable expansion in other `Dockerfile` instructions. This is not meant for passing secret values.  For example, the build arg `FOO=bar` would become `{\"FOO\":\"bar\"}` in JSON. This would result in the query parameter `buildargs={\"FOO\":\"bar\"}`. Note that `{\"FOO\":\"bar\"}` should be URI component encoded.  [Read more about the buildargs instruction.](/engine/reference/builder/#arg) 
instance HasOptionalParam ImageBuild Buildargs where

    req `addQuery` toQuery ("networkmode", Just xs)
instance HasOptionalParam ImageBuild ParamContentType where
  applyOptionalParam req (ParamContentType xs) =
    req `addHeader` toHeader ("Content-type", xs)

-- | /Optional Param/ "X-Registry-Config" - This is a base64-encoded JSON object with auth configurations for multiple registries that a build may refer to.  The key is a registry URL, and the value is an auth configuration object, [as described in the authentication section](#section/Authentication). For example:  ``` {   \"docker.example.com\": {     \"username\": \"janedoe\",     \"password\": \"hunter2\"   },   \"https://index.docker.io/v1/\": {     \"username\": \"mobydock\",     \"password\": \"conta1n3rize14\"   } } ```  Only the registry domain name (and port if not the default 443) are required. However, for legacy reasons, the Docker Hub registry must be specified with both a `https://` prefix and a `/v1/` suffix even though Docker will prefer to use the v2 registry API.

If `name` is an image ID, similarly only that image (and its parents) are returned, but with the exclusion of the `repositories` file in the tarball, as there were no image names referenced.  ### Image tarball format  An image tarball contains one directory per image layer (named using its long ID), each containing these files:  - `VERSION`: currently `1.0` - the file format version - `json`: detailed layer information, similar to `docker inspect layer_id` - `layer.tar`: A tarfile containing the filesystem changes in this layer  The `layer.tar` file contains `aufs` style `.wh..wh.aufs` files and directories for storing attribute changes and deletions.  If the tarball defines a repository, the tarball should also include a `repositories` file at the root that contains a list of repository and tag names mapped to layer IDs.  ```json {   \"hello-world\": {     \"latest\": \"565a9d68a73f6706862bfe8409a7f659776d4d60a8d096eb4a3cbce6999cc2a1\"   } } ```
